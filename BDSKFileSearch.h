 Search Kit is easy to use if you fully create the index, then search it (as we do with BibItem indexes).  Unfortunately, that's really slow for files, so we want to display results while indexing.  Search Kit gets in our way at a few points:  
 
    - SKSearchRef is a one-shot object, and basically works with a snapshot of the index.  
      Therefore, it needs to be recreated each time the index is updated, even if the 
      search string doesn't change, or you don't get new results.
 
    - SKSearchRef searches asynchronously, so SKSearchFindMatches needs to be called 
      in a loop until all matches are found.
 
    - There's no way to search incrementally, so each time you call SKSearchFindMatches 
      you get all results found previously.
 
    - Search scores need to be renormalized every time you call SKSearchFindMatches.
  
 BDSKFileContentSearchController creates/owns the BDSKFileSearchIndex, since the index needs a pointer to the document (initially) for notification registration and indexing.  BDSKFileContentSearchController creates/owns a single BDSKFileSearch and implements the BDSKSearchDelegate protocol to get updates from the BDSKFileSearch (what new items were found).  BDSKFileSearch creates and returns BDSKFileSearchResult objects to the controller for display.
 
 BDSKFileSearchIndex is a wrapper around an SKIndexRef that handles document/pub changes on a worker thread.  BDSKFileSearch conforms to the BDSKFileSearchIndexDelegate protocol, which allows the BDSKFileSearch to keep updating as new files are indexed, until the search is canceled or the index is done updating.  
 
  BDSKFileSearchResult is a simple container that wraps a search result (URL, title, icon, score) for display.  It implements -hash and -isEqual: so can be used in an NSSet; this was the primary reason it was written, since an NSSet was used to only add new results to the BDSKFileContentSearchController's NSArrayController in order to preserve selection.  At present, it's a simple container with accessors for type checking (vs. an NSMutableDictionary).
 
 So this is how we get incremental updates during indexing: 
 
  1) The BDSKFileSearchIndex informs BDSKFileSearch (its delegate) that new files have been added.  
  2) BDSKFileSearch cancels its current SKSearchRef and creates a new one.  
  3) BDSKFileSearch flushes the index and finds matches for the new SKSearchRef.
  4) All results of the new search are then accumulated and sent to the controller (delegate).
  5) Repeat 1--4 until indexing is complete
