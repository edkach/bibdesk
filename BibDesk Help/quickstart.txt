## Quick Start for those already familiar with BibTeX

Using BibDesk should be pretty natural for the average user of
BibTeX. Simply open your .bib file with BibDesk and start [browsing and editing](managing.html).
To get you up to speed faster, here are a few important features and
differences from other BibTeX editors.

### Accented Characters

If you are used to writing LaTeX code for accented characters and
special fonts, you will be glad to know that BibDesk handles most of
that work for you now. See [Editing references](managing.html#editing)
for an overview, or [Character Conversion](char-convert.html) for more detail.

### Capitalized letters in fields

If you use braces in your BibTeX fields to protect meaningful
captialization, BibDesk attempts not to interfere. The braces will be
saved and any previews will show the intended capitalization.

Searches will match the string without the braces - a search for
"LaTeX" will match a publication with the title "{L}a{T}e{X}".

### File Encodings

If you have a BibTeX file that is not stored with ASCII encoding, see
[Opening a file with specific encodings](open-import.html#encoding)

### Citation Keys

BibDesk can help you maintain useful and readable citation keys
painlessly. See [Cite-key generation](cite-key.html) for more information.

### Macros

BibDesk supports BibTeX macros. See [BibTeX macros](managing.html#edit-macro) for more information.

### BibDesk Does Not Recognize `crossref`

BibDesk does not currently take advantage of the BibTeX crossref
feature for display or searching, but if you use crossrefs, using
BibDesk will not break them. If you would like to send feedback about
this, see [Getting More Help](morehelp.html).
