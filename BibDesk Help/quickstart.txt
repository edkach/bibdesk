## Quick Start for those already familiar with BibTeX

Using BibDesk should be pretty natural for the average user of
BibTeX. Simply open a .bib file with BibDesk and start browsing and
editing.

If you are used to writing LaTeX code for accented characters and
special fonts, you will be glad to know that BibDesk handles most of
that work for you now. See [Editing references](managing.html#editing)
for an overview, or [Character Conversion](char-convert.html) for more detail.

If you have a BibTeX file that is not stored with ASCII encoding, see
[Opening a file with specific encodings](open-import.html#encoding)

BibDesk can help you maintain useful and readable citation keys
painlessly. See [Cite-key generation](cite-key.html) for more information.

BibDesk supports BibTeX macros. See [BibTeX macros](managing.html#edit-macro) for more information.

BibDesk does not currently take advantage of the BibTeX crossref
feature for display or searching, but if you use crossrefs, using
BibDesk will not break them. If you would like to send feedback about
this, see [Getting More Help](morehelp.html).
