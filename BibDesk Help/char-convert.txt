## Character Conversion

### What is character conversion? 

BibDesk automatically converts many accented characters into their
TeXequivalents when it writes a BibTeX file.&nbsp; For instance , a Ÿ
isconverted to {\"u} when your file is saved, but presented as Ÿ in
theinterface.&nbsp; There are some limitations on this process;
conversiononly works when a {\ sequence is encountered, as in the
above example,and it only works if BibDesk has the conversion stored
in its internal dictionary.

		

If you encounter a warning that BibDesk was unable to convert an
accented character into aTeX sequence, please e-mail the BibDesk <a
href="mailto:bibdesk-develop@sourceforge.net?Subject=Character%20Conversion%20Error">developers'
mailing list</a> with a description of the character and its TeX
equivalent. This will enable us to add the character to the next
release of BibDesk.

### Accented characters and TeX 

The following table was taken from <i>The
Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX2e</i> (Oetiker et al., 1999).&nbsp;
Depending on your TeX distribution, it may be available at
`/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.tetex/doc/latex/general/lshort.dvi`, or it is available from <a
href="http://www.ctan.org/ctan/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/">CTAN</a>.

Many of the accents listed in this table can be applied to characters
other than o, as well.  <img alt="Character Table"

<i>Note</i>:&nbsp; for BibTeX, it is also necessary to
enclose the accent sequence in braces (see the <a
href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=bibaccent">TeX
FAQ</a>).
