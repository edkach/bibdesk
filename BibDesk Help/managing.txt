## Managing references

This section will outline starting a new bibliography and many ways of adding references.
It includes a few gems about drag and drop, so don't skip too quick.


Choose "New Bibliography" from the File menu or type the keyboard
shortcut &#8984;&#8679;N. New references are added to the bibliography
with "New Reference" from the Bibliography menu or the keyboard
shortcut &#8984;N. This opens the Editor window, which looks something
like this:

You can then fill in the appropriate fields for your reference. The type pop-up menu lets you choose from the canonical BibTeX publication types (e.g., article, book, phdthesis). Field titles highlighted in red represent required fields for the chosen reference type (article in the case of the above screenshot). Fields can be added and removed with the plus and minus buttons to the right of the reference-type pop-up menu. BibDesk fills in fields as you type based on the information contained in other references. Also, BibDesk verifies that cite keys are unique before committing a reference to the bibliography.



Urls typed into the reference listing become active hyperlinks near the top of the Editor window. Dragging a file onto the Edit window adds the files location to the "Local-Url" field and creates a clickable link to the file. Clicking in the box adjacent to "File:" presents a file dialog for choosing the appropriate file. The "View in Drawer" buttons show either the entire PDF file or the first page of the file as text, which can be copied and pasted into the publication's data fields.


The "Annote" and "Abstract" tabs provide access to larger text areas for these types of information. Rss-Description is covered in `Exporting to RSS`_.


The references are presented in a table, similar to this:

<img src="gfx/tableView.png" alt="" height="608" width="617">

References can also be added to a bibliography by dragging an entry from a text source (text editor, web browser). Here's a fancy picture:

<img src="gfx/dragIntoBib.png" alt="" height="263" width="388">

Below the table view is the Notes pane, which shows the contents of
the highlighted reference. It can also be set (in the [General
preference pane](prefs.html#general) to show the entire selected entry as nicely formatted
text.

### Editing references

Once references have been added to the bibliography, they can be
edited by selecting a reference and choosing "Edit Reference" from the
Bibliography menu, typing &#8984;E, or double-clicking the
reference. When editing, changing pub type never loses information. In
other words, if you put a booktitle in when it was inproceedings, and
you change it to phdthesis, it will still have that booktitle.


#### Entering Accented Characters

You can enter many common accented characters such as  and o directly, and 
Bibdesk will take care of translating them into the appropriate LaTeX definitions when the file is saved.

They will also be re-translated upon reopening the file, so that you
will see the intended character, not the markup LaTeX uses to generate
it.

#### Editing Macros

FIXME

You can edit a field as raw BibTeX by pressing &#8984;R in the edit
window when one of the form fields has the keyboard focus.

#### Editing Macro Definitions

### Deleting References

References can be deleted by selecting the reference and choosing
"Delete Reference" from the Bibliography menu or pressing the delete
key. Either way, a warning will appear to verify that you want to
delete the reference.


### Printing references

Choosing "Print" from the File menu (&#8984;P) prints the contents
of the lower browser pane of the selected reference.


### Saving a bibliography

Save (&#8984;S) and Save As... (&#8984;&#8679;S) under the File
menu will save your bibliography as a BibTeX file. 

To save a file with an encoding other than the one it was read in
using, use the "Export BibTeX With Encoding" command, found in the 
"Export" sub-menu of the "File Menu". Choose the encoding you want
from the pop-up button at the bottom of the resulting sheet.


### The Preview panel

The preview panel shows you the currently selected references as a
formatted bibliography. The bibliography's format is based on the
current style file (set in <a href="prefs.html#preview">Preview
preferences</a>). This helps in spotting errors and omissions in your
references. The preview file will also reflect any macros you have
included in your template file, if you have included them in the
current bib-item.
