## Opening and Importing Files


### Starting a new file

Choose "New Bibliography" from the File menu or type the keyboard shortcut \ |cmd|\ |shift|\ N. 

<a name="encoding"/>
### Opening a file in a specific encoding

Use the "Open..." menu item in the File menu, and select the encoding
you want to use from the popup menu at the bottom of the dialog box.

### Opening a file using a command-line filter

This feature lets you specify any command line that produces a BibTeX
file and open it in BibDesk directly. If you have command line
conversion tools from other formats, this is a handy way to use them.

FIXME: Example

### Importing from PubMed (RIS)

BibDesk expects a file with the extension &#8216;.fcgi&#8217; and of
MIME type &#8216;application/x-Research-Info-Systems&#8217;. If you
don't know what that means, that's OK. Just do your search as usual on
PubMed, and then select the settings as in the following image:

The important settings are that it should be set to Display
&#8216;MEDLINE&#8217; and Send to &#8216;File&#8217;. Then click the
&#8216;Send to&#8217; button, and a file &#8216;query.fcgi&#8217; will
be saved to your download folder. You can then use BibDesk to open
this file. Once you have opened the file it cannot be saved back in
the same format. If you want to, you can save it as a BibTeX file, or
transfer the translated entries over into a BibTeX file that you use
permanently.
