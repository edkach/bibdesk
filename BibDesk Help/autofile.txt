## Keeping Local Copies of Papers Organized

This help page describes how to use the AutoFile feature to keep your
electronic copies of papers organized.  You will need to choose a
Papers Folder as described in the 
[AutoFile preference pane help topic][preftopic]

### Topics:

* [Consolidate Linked Files](#consolidate) - Move all linked files to
  your Papers Folder.

* [Automatically Move Files](#automatic) - How Bibdesk can keep new papers organized automatically once you've consolidated them.

### Consolidate Linked Files

![Consolidate Linked Files Menu Item](gfx/consolidateLinkedFiles.png)

Choose this command to scan all publications in the file for linked
files. A preview window will be opened that shows you some information
about each of the linked files. You can then choose to move them all
to your Papers Folder or cancel.

If any files can not be moved or renamed for some reason, an error
dialog will show you what the problems were:

Consolidating linked files is undoable, so feel free to experiment.


### Automatically Move Files

When linking a file by dragging and dropping it onto an edit window or
the publications table, or by using the Choose File button in the edit
window, AutoFile will automatically move the file to the Papers Folder
if the "File Papers Automatically" preference is selected, as
described in the [AutoFile preference pane help topic][preftopic].
