## Inserting Citations Into Documents

You can copy a publication from the publication table and paste it
into any text editor to get the TeX citation command for that
publication's citation key. You can also drag and drop the
publications.

This also works for multiple publications at once. Multiple selections
produce a single citation containing the highlighted references (i.e.,
`\cite{key1,key2}`).

The [Citation preferences](prefs.html#citation) allow for separate citations
(i.e., `\cite{key1}\cite{key2}`).

If you need a different citation command, then you will
want to use the Custom Citation Strings Drawer.

### The Custom Citation Strings Drawer

Choosing Show/Hide Custom Citation Strings from the Window menu
(&#8984;&#8679;C) toggles a drawer that allows you to drag and drop
citations into a TeX document using custom-defined citation strings,
such as fullcite, citet, and citep.

### Autocompletion

BibDesk can install a plugin that lets you search your database and
insert citation commands conveniently without leaving your text
editing application. More detail about that is in the [autocompletion
help page](autocompletion.html)

<a name="service"/>
### System Service

If you can't use the autocompletion plugin because your favorite text
editor is not compatible (for instance BBEdit or TextWrangler), you
will be able to use the installed OS X System Services to do much of
the same thing. 

The services also perform some searching functionality which can help
if you don't have a photographic memory of citation keys.

In any Services aware app (At least: TeXShop, iTeXMac, TextEdit, but
notably not BBEdit for OS X and no Classic or X windows apps) type a
string, select it, then choose Complete Citation from the Bibdesk
submenu of the Services Menu. This will replace the selected string
with the citation(s) of any entries in open BibDesk documents (or, if
BibDesk is not open yet, in the default bibliography set in <a
href="prefs.htm">Preferences</a>) whose titles contain that
string. So:

<img src="gfx/serviceBefore.png" alt="" height="121" width="335">

becomes:

<img src="gfx/serviceAfter.png" alt="" height="102" width="450">


You can search more than just the title from the service. For example:

* "foo" and "Title = foo" search for "foo" in the title.
* "Author = Baz Title = foo & Month = Jan" searches for those constraints.


Another service is available, called "Complete Cite Key" which allows
you to highlight a part of a citation key and BibDesk will complete
the key for you. For instance, in our example , selecting
&#8216;CasO&#8217; and invoking the &#8216;Complete Cite Key&#8217;
service would insert &#8216;CasObe00&#8217;.
