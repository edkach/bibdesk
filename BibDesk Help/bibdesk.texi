@heading About BibDesk

BibDesk @value{VERSION} is a BibTeX editor and reference manager. Because it is a
BibTeX editor, it is important to understand at least a few things
about the BibTeX file format.

@enumerate

@item If you already have a BibTeX database and are moving from hand-editing
      or another BibTeX editor, start at the @ref{Quick Start}.

@item If you are just getting started keeping track of references or are
  moving from a program such as EndNote or
  another reference manager, see the @ref{BibTeX Intro}.

@node Quick Start
@chapter Quick Start 

Using BibDesk should be pretty natural for the average user of
BibTeX. Simply open your .bib file with BibDesk and start working. @xref{Managing References}
To get you up to speed faster, here are a few important features and
differences from other BibTeX editors.

@heading Accented Characters

@cindex accented characters
If you are used to writing LaTeX code for accented characters and
special fonts, you will be glad to know that BibDesk handles most of
that work for you now. See @ref{Editing References}
for an overview, or @ref{Character Conversion} for more detail.

@heading Capitalized Letters in Fields

@cindex capitalization
If you use braces in your BibTeX fields to protect meaningful
captialization, BibDesk attempts not to interfere. The braces will be
saved and any previews will show the intended capitalization.

Searches will match the string without the braces - a search for
"LaTeX" will match a publication with the title "@verb{.{L}a{T}e{X}.}".

@heading File Encodings

@cindex encodings
If you have a BibTeX file that is not stored with ASCII encoding,
BibDesk will work with the file's encoding. See @ref{encoding-notes}
for further information.

@heading Citation Keys

BibDesk can help you maintain useful and readable citation keys
painlessly. See @ref{Cite Key Preferences} for more information.

@heading Macro Support

@cindex macro
BibDesk supports BibTeX macros. See @ref{Editing Fields with Macros} and
@ref{Editing Macro Definitions} for more information on how to edit
them.

@heading BibDesk Does Not Recognize @code{crossref}

@cindex crossref
BibDesk does not currently take advantage of the BibTeX crossref
feature for display or searching, but if you use crossrefs, using
BibDesk will not break them. If you would like to send feedback about
this, see @ref{Getting More Help}.


@node BibTeX Intro
@chapter BibTeX Intro

@cindex bibtex

BibTeX database files are in a text format with a few conventions you
will want to know. See @ref{Formatting Names} and
 @ref{Publication Types}) for answers to common questions.

It helps to know what the parts of a BibTeX file are. Here's a trivial
example to help illustrate. First we have a *macro definition*:

@example
@@string@{"PACT" = "International Conference on Processors, Architectures and Compilation Techniques"@}
@end example

Next a single entry:
@example
@@proceedings@{pact02,
	    booktitle = PACT,
	    Year = 2002,
	    Month = sep,
	    Address = "Harvard Square"@}
@end example

The terminology we'll use to describe the entry is as follows:

@example
@@publication-type@{citation-key, field-name = value@}
@end example

Any value can be either a quoted string (using either `""` or `@{@}`) or a
number, or a macro (like `PACT` in the above example).

@anchor{Publication Types}
@heading Publication Types

Each publication is assigned a type, which along with carrying some
information about the publication, determines how it will be formatted
later in conjunction with BibTeX styles.

@heading Citation Keys

Must be unique.

@heading Field data


Any field can be in any type.

@anchor{Formatting Names}
@heading Formatting Names

Author and editor lists in BibTeX files are written as a single string
using the word "and" as a separator between names, like this example:

@example
"Adam Maxwell and Michael O. McCracken"
@end example

If a name has two parts, commas are used to determine which parts are
the first, middle and last names. For example, the following two names
are the same:

@example
"Adam Maxwell" "Maxwell, Adam"
@end example

BibTeX also handles more complicated names. Prefixes to given names
such as *van* or *van den* and suffixes such as *Jr.* or *III* are
OK:

@example
"van den Huevel, Johan A, Jr."
@end example

@heading BibTeX Macros

@cindex macro

Macro definitions look like this:
@example
@@string@{"PACT" = "International Conference on Processors, Architectures and Compilation Techniques"@}
@end example

Macro uses just use the first part of the definition without quotes as
the value for a field in the BibTeX file.

Macros are a time saving feature that save typing when you have to
repeat the same long journal name over and over. If you define a
macro, you can just type the short version and BibTeX will substitute
the full version in processing.

Note that in our example, we also used a macro *sep*, which was not
defined in the example. Common three-letter month names are usually
defined appropriately in your `Style Files`_ for the document's
language, and may also be abbreviated depending on the citation style.


BibDesk supports reading, editing and saving BibTeX macros. See
@ref{Editing Fields with Macros} for further information.

@end menu

@node Starting a New File
@section Starting a New File
@abstract{Various ways of Creating a New File}

Choose "New Bibliography" from the File menu or 
type the keyboard shortcut @cmd{} @shift{} N. 

@subsection Opening a File in a Specific Encoding

Use the "Open..." menu item in the File menu, and select the encoding
you want to use from the popup menu at the bottom of the dialog
box.

@subsection Opening a File Using a Command-Line Filter

This feature lets you specify any command line that produces a BibTeX
file and open it in BibDesk directly. If you have command line
conversion tools from other formats, this is a handy way to use them.

FIXME: Example

@node Opening a PubMed File
@section Opening a PubMed File

@cindex PubMed
@cindex RIS
BibDesk expects a file with the extension ``.fcgi'' and of
MIME type ``application/x-Research-Info-Systems''. If you
don't know what that means, that's OK. Just do your search as usual on
PubMed, and then select the settings as in the following image:

@image{gfx/pubmed}

The important settings are that it should be set to Display
``MEDLINE'' and Send to ``File''. Then click the
``Send to'' button, and a file ``query.fcgi'' will
be saved to your download folder. You can then use BibDesk to open
this file. Once you have opened the file it cannot be saved back in
the same format. If you want to, you can save it as a BibTeX file, or
transfer the translated entries over into a BibTeX file that you use
permanently.

@node Searching Your Database
@chapter Searching Your Database

@cindex searching

@heading Quick Search

The quick search field lets you enter sub-strings that might be in
author names, titles or dates, and the reference view will display
only matching publications. There are several built-in options. For
example, All Fields (search every entry except the pub type at once),
Keywords (search the keywords entries) and Pub Type (search by pub
type).

@image{gfx/quickSearchField}

The quick search field is configurable by selecting "Add Field...",
which allows you to add any string you want to the menu. If a
publication has that field, it will be searched. Adding the field
"Cite Key" (with that exact capitalization) will allow you to search
the citation key of publications. (All Fields also searches the
citation key.)

@subheading Advanced Searches

@cindex Boolean
@cindex accents

BibDesk's quick search field also supports a Boolean search, using
"AND" or "OR" operators (no quotes, but the operator must be
capitalized).  Please note that grouping is not supported at this
time.  The search feature will also consider accented and non-accented
characters as equivalent, and is case-insensitive
(i.e. "BÃ¼rger" can be found by searching for "burger" or
"BÃ¼rGeR").

shortcut @cmd{} N, or the New Reference toolbar button.

#fixme: Add info about text import

This opens the Editor window, which looks something
like this:

@image{gfx/editWindow}

You can then fill in the appropriate fields for your reference. The
type pop-up menu lets you choose from the canonical BibTeX publication
types (e.g., article, book, phdthesis). Field titles highlighted in
red represent required fields for the chosen reference type (article
in the case of the above screenshot). Fields can be added and removed
with the plus and minus buttons to the right of the reference-type
pop-up menu. BibDesk fills in fields as you type based on the
information contained in other references. Also, BibDesk verifies that
cite keys are unique before committing a reference to the
bibliography.

@cindex URL
@cindex Local-URL
@cindex File
@cindex PDF
@cindex previewing files
@cindex viewing PDF as text

FIXME: update

Urls typed into the reference listing become active hyperlinks near
the top of the Editor window. Dragging a file onto the Edit window
adds the files location to the "Local-Url" field and creates a
clickable link to the file. Clicking in the box adjacent to "File:"
presents a file dialog for choosing the appropriate file. The "View in
Drawer" buttons show either the entire PDF file or the first page of
the file as text, which can be copied and pasted into the
publication's data fields.


The "Annote" and "Abstract" tabs provide access to larger text areas
for these types of information. Rss-Description is covered in
`Exporting to RSS`_.


The references are presented in a table, similar to this:

@image{gfx/tableView}

References can also be added to a bibliography by dragging an entry
from a text source (text editor, web browser). Here's a fancy picture:

@image{gfx/dragIntoBib}

Below the table view is the Notes pane, which shows the contents of
the highlighted reference. It can also be set (in the 
@ref{General Preferences} Preferences) to show the entire selected entry as nicely formatted
text.


@node Editing References
@section Editing References
@kindex cmd-E

Once references have been added to the bibliography, they can be
edited by selecting a reference and choosing "Edit Reference" from the
Bibliography menu, typing @cmd{}E, or double-clicking the
reference. When editing, changing pub type never loses information. In
other words, if you put a booktitle in when it was inproceedings, and
you change it to phdthesis, it will still have that booktitle.

@node Entering Accented Characters
@subsection Entering Accented Characters

@cindex accented characters

You can enter many common accented characters such as  and o directly, and 
Bibdesk will take care of translating them into the appropriate LaTeX definitions when the file is saved.

They will also be re-translated upon reopening the file, so that you
will see the intended character, not the markup LaTeX uses to generate
it.

@node Saving The File
@section Saving The File

@cindex saving

Save (@cmd{}S) and Save As... (@cmd{}@shift{}S) under the File
menu will save your bibliography as a BibTeX file. 

@cindex encoding
To save a file with an encoding other than the one it was read in
using, use the "Export BibTeX With Encoding" command, found in the 
"Export" sub-menu of the "File Menu". Choose the encoding you want
from the pop-up button at the bottom of the resulting sheet.

@node Previewing Typeset Output
@section Previewing Typeset Output

@kindex cmd-T

``@ref{Preview Preferences}''). This helps in spotting errors and omissions in your
references. The preview file will also reflect any macros you have

@node Inserting Citations
@chapter Inserting Citations

@cindex Copy and Paste
@cindex Drag and Drop

You can copy a publication from the publication table and paste it
into any text editor to get the TeX citation command for that
publication's citation key. You can also drag and drop the
publications.

This also works for multiple publications at once. Multiple selections
produce a single citation containing the highlighted references (i.e.,
@code{\cite@{key1,key2@}}).

The @ref{Cite Key Preferences} allow for separate citations
(i.e., @code{\cite@{key1@}\cite@{key2@}}).

If you need a different citation command, then you will
want to use the Custom Citation Strings Drawer.

@menu
* The Custom Citation Strings Drawer::  
* Autocompletion::              
* System Service::              
@end menu

@node The Custom Citation Strings Drawer
@section The Custom Citation Strings Drawer

Choosing Show/Hide Custom Citation Strings from the Window menu
(@cmd{}@shift{}C) toggles a drawer that allows you to drag and drop
citations into a TeX document using custom-defined citation strings,
such as fullcite, citet, and citep.

@image{gfx/citeDrawer}

@node Autocompletion
@section Autocompletion

BibDesk can install a plugin that lets you search your database and
insert citation commands conveniently without leaving your text
editing application. @xref{External Autocompletion}

@node System Service
@section System Service

@cindex System Service
@cindex services

If you can't use the autocompletion plugin because your favorite text
editor is not compatible (for instance BBEdit or TextWrangler), you
will be able to use the installed OS X System Services to do much of
the same thing. 

The services also perform some searching functionality which can help
if you don't have a photographic memory of citation keys.

In any Services aware app (At least: TeXShop, iTeXMac, TextEdit, but
notably not BBEdit for OS X and no Classic or X windows apps) type a
string, select it, then choose Complete Citation from the Bibdesk
submenu of the Services Menu. This will replace the selected string
with the citation(s) of any entries in open BibDesk documents (or, if
BibDesk is not open yet, in the default bibliography set in
@ref{General Preferences} Preferences) whose titles contain that
string. So:

@image{gfx/serviceBefore}

becomes:

@image{gfx/serviceAfter}


You can search more than just the title from the service.
Both of the next two examples search for the string ``foo'' in the title:
@example
"foo"
@end example
@example 
"Title = foo"
@end example

The next example searches for a publication with ``Baz'' in the
author, ``foo'' in the title, and ``Jan'' in the month:

@example
"Author = Baz & Title = foo & Month = Jan"
@end example


Another service is available, called "Complete Cite Key" which allows
you to highlight a part of a citation key and BibDesk will complete
the key for you. For instance, in our example , selecting
``CasO'' and invoking the ``Complete Cite Key''
service would insert ``CasObe00''.

@heading Bug reports

You can submit a bug report to the bug tracker at 
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/bibdesk/}.

The reports are most useful if they provide a clear description of
what went wrong, what you expected, and how to reproduce the problem
at a different computer without you there helping us.

If you're submitting a problem with how it handled a certain file, it
would help if you sent that file too, or at least the representative
subset that causes the errors. Crash reports are also useful and can
be obtained from the Console application (in `Applications/Utilities`).

@node Character Conversion
@appendix Character Conversion

@heading What is character conversion? 

BibDesk automatically converts many accented characters into their
TeXequivalents when it writes a BibTeX file. For instance, a u
with umlaut 
is converted to @code{@{\"u@}} when your file is saved, but presented as-is in
theinterface. There are some limitations on this process;
conversion only works when a @code{@{\} sequence is encountered, as in the
above example, and it only works if BibDesk has the conversion stored
in its internal dictionary.

If you encounter a warning that BibDesk was unable to convert an
accented character into aTeX sequence, please e-mail the BibDesk 
@uref{mailto:bibdesk-develop@@sourceforge.net?Subject=Character%20Conversion%20Error, developers' mailing list} with a description of the character and its TeX
equivalent. This will enable us to add the character to the next
release of BibDesk.

@heading Accented characters and TeX 

The following table was taken from The
Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX2e> (Oetiker et al., 1999).
Depending on your TeX distribution, it may be available at
@code{/usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf.tetex/doc/latex/general/lshort.dvi}, or it is available from @uref{http://www.ctan.org/ctan/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/, CTAN}.

Many of the accents listed in this table can be applied to characters
other than o, as well.  

@image{gfx/accents}

Note: for BibTeX, it is also necessary to enclose the accent sequence in braces (see the @uref{http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=bibaccent, TeX FAQ}).


@node Citation Key Format Reference
@appendix Citation Key Format Reference


@heading Syntax of the format

The format is used for autogeneration of certain values, such as the cite key and the local-url. The format is a string containing special format specifiers, which are replaced by strings determined by the bibliography data. Most format specifiers have the form of a %-character followed by a single character. It can be followed by optional digits, which serve as parameters for the format specifier. Possible format specifiers are given in the table below.

In the table above, green characters after the specifiers indicate the optional parameters (the first number after an author specifier, the number of authors, should be a single digit). Indicated in the table are the parameter values that are used when they are not entered. 
</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
The special value of zero for an optional parameter is interpreted either as <em>all</em> (for the &#8216;author&#8217;, &#8216;title&#8217;, or &#8216;field&#8217; specifiers), <em>sufficient</em> (for the &#8216;unique&#8217; specifiers, i.e., sufficient to create a unique cite key), or <em>none</em> (for the &#8216;random&#8217; specifiers). 
</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
The format can contain only a single one of the &#8216;unique&#8217; specifiers <span class="spec">%u</span>, <span class="spec">%U</span> and <span class="spec">%n</span>. 
</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
The optional parameters delimited by square brackets after an author specifier can be used to control the separator between author names and an optional &#8216;et al.&#8217; suffix. For <span class="spec">%A</span>, the first one is the separator between two author names, and the second one is the separator between the last name and the first initial. 
</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
Because a number right after most specifiers is interpreted as an optional parameter, in order to use explicit digits right after a format specifier, one should use one of the escape specifiers <span class="spec">%0</span>-<span class="spec">%9</span>. 
</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
The cite key format can contain, apart from the specifiers, only unaccented alphanumeric characters (a-zA-Z0-9), (semi-)colons (:;), dashes (-) or periods (.). Any generated part of the cite key will be converted to contain only those characters. For example, accents are removed and spaces will be converted to dashes. 
</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
The format for the local-url can contain any character apart from colons (:). To use an explicit percent character, use the escape specifier <span class="spec">%%</span> (except inside an optional argument delimited by square brackets).
