## For users new to BibTeX

BibTeX database files are in a text format with a few conventions you
will want to know. See [Formatting Names](#names) and
 [Publication Types](#pubtypes) for answers to common questions.

It helps to know what the parts of a BibTeX file are. Here's a trivial
example to help illustrate. First we have a *macro definition*:

> @string{"PACT" = "International Conference on Processors, Architectures and Compilation Techniques"}

Next a single *entry*:


>    @proceedings{pact02,
>	    booktitle = PACT,
>	    Year = 2002,
>	    Month = sep,
>	    Address = "Harvard Square"}

The terminology we'll use to describe the entry is as follows:

> @*publication type*{*citation key*, *field name* = *value*}

Any value can be either a quoted string (using either `""` or `{}`) or a
number, or a macro (like `PACT` in the above example).

<a name="pubtypes"/>
### Publication Types

Each publication is assigned a type, which along with carrying some
information about the publication, determines how it will be formatted
later in conjunction with BibTeX styles.

<a name="citekeys"/>
### Citation Keys

Must be unique.

<a name="fields"/>
### Field data


Any field can be in any type.

<a name="names"/>
### Formatting Names

Author and editor lists in BibTeX files are written as a single string
using the word "and" as a separator between names, like this example:

> "Adam Maxwell and Michael O. McCracken"

If a name has two parts, commas are used to determine which parts are
the first, middle and last names. For example, the following two names
are the same:

>"Adam Maxwell" "Maxwell, Adam"

BibTeX also handles more complicated names. Prefixes to given names
such as *van* or *van den* and suffixes such as *Jr.* or *III* are
OK:

>"van den Huevel, Johan A, Jr."

<a name="macros"/>
### Macros

Macro definitions look like this:
> @string{"PACT" = "International Conference on Processors, Architectures and Compilation Techniques"}

Macro uses just use the first part of the definition without quotes as
the value for a field in the BibTeX file.

Macros are a time saving feature that save typing when you have to
repeat the same long journal name over and over. If you define a
macro, you can just type the short version and BibTeX will substitute
the full version in processing.

Note that in our example, we also used a macro *sep*, which was not
defined in the example. Common three-letter month names are usually
defined appropriately in your `Style Files`_ for the document's
language, and may also be abbreviated depending on the citation style.

BibDesk supports reading, editing and saving BibTeX macros. See
[Editing Macros](managing.txt#edit-macro) for further information.
