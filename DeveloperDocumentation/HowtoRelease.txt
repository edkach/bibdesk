How To Release BibDesk

- clean the project in Release configuration, make sure you also clean the dependencies and precompiled header

- change version numbers
  *  Info.plist
  *  version.texi
  *  Info.plist and InfoPlist.strings in the BibImporter project
  *  Info.plist and InfoPlist.strings in the QuickLook-BibDesk project

- run "agvtool bump"

- update release notes as necessary by reading commit-list messages

- commit changes

- tag the source using `svn copy -m "Tag for release" https://bibdesk.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/bibdesk/trunk https://bibdesk.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/bibdesk/tags/REL_1_x_x` where REL_1_x_x is the new version number

- recompile the "BibDesk" target in Release configuration

- build the "DiskImage" target, which should drop a disk image and an (partial) appcast XML on your desktop

- follow the sf.net release instructions
  *  in the BibDesk project, follow the "Feature Settings" item in the "Project Admin" menu, and click Manage for the "File Release System"
  *  you want to use "Add Release" for BibDesk
  *  name the release the same as the disk image (without the dmg part)
  *  file release docs:  http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Release%20files%20for%20download
  *  web upload:  https://frs.sourceforge.net/webupload

- edit the web page (sidebar.html) to point to the new release
  *  release notes URL

- update the release notes lines in the generated appcast XML using <li> elements

- insert the <item> from the generated and edited appcast XML in bibdesk.xml on the web server, above the older <item>s

- test the new download from the sourceforge.net downloads

- copy the edited bibdesk.xml back to the server

- post appropriate messages to bibdesk-announce and bibdesk-users (someone should also post to macosx-tex)
