How To Release BibDesk

- clean the project in Release configuration, make sure you also clean the depdendencies and precompiled header
- change version numbers
  *  Info.plist
  *  version.texi
  *  Info.plist and InfoPlist.strings in the BibImporter project
  *  Info.plist and InfoPlist.strings in the QuickLook-BibDesk project
- run "agvtool bump"
- update release notes as necessary by reading commit-list messages
- commit changes
- tag the source using `svn copy -m "Tag for release" https://bibdesk.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/bibdesk/trunk https://bibdesk.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/bibdesk/tags/REL_1_x_x` where REL_1_x_x is the new version number
- recompile the "BibDesk" target in Release configuration
- build the "DiskImage" target, which should drop a disk image and an appcast XML on your desktop
- follow the sf.net release instructions
  *  you want to use "Add Release" for BibDesk
  *  name the release the same as the disk image (without the dmg part)
- edit the web page (sidebar.html) to point to the new release
  *  download URL
  *  release notes URL
- update the release notes lines in the appcast XML using <li> elements
- insert the <item> from the appcast XML in bibdesk.xml on the web server
- test the new download from the home page
- post appropriate messages to bibdesk-announce and bibdesk-users (someone should also post to macosx-tex)
